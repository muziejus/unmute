Yi Hsuan Lai (b,1988) is a visual artist from Taiwan currently working in New
York. She recently completed her MFA in Photography and Related Video Media
from the School of Visual Arts. Her graphic design and live theatre documentation
background led her to develop an artistic process that combines performance,
staged self-portraiture, installation, and sculpture-based photography. Yi Hsuan
Lai combines photography and sculpture to create work that speaks to the physical
and psychological experiences that reflect the complexity of self-identity and the
Otherness. Lai also experiments with the representation of sensations through
physical materials to capture an imagined world. By incorporating costumes and
sculptures she makes for her self-portraits, her photographs validate the bodily
transformation to respond and reflect the exterior and interior worlds.

Her work has been shown in Anonymous Town SPRING/BREAK Art Show (2020, New York),The Thing In Itself in NARS Residency (2020, New York), In visible space in Here Art (2020, New York), Body language in Deer studio (2020, New York), WONDER FOTO Day (2019, Taiwan), Break a leg in Photo emphasis Suger gallery(2019, Fayetteville).
