Marie Lukáčová graduated from the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design and has also studied at the Faculty of Fine Arts at Brno University of Technology and at Kunstakademie Mainz in Germany. She is one of the founders of the Fourth Wave feminist group which initiated public debate on sexism at universities in 2017. She works primarily in the media of video and video installation; her films transform symbols borrowed from the fields of politics, mythology, geology and science. They move across various time levels and locations, addressing the questions of uncertain future through specific narratives and poetics. Lukáčová has introduced her work primarily on the Czech independent gallery scene as well as in Wrocław, Ljubljana and Stuttgart.
