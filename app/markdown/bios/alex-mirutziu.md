Alex Mirutziu's (b. Romania) practice extends over a wide range of media and activities, including sculpture, film, drawing, poetry and performance as well as critical and curatorial projects. 

Mirutziu’s practice interrogates the ontological medium of ‘remaining’ exploring the conflict between desire and strategic action. Inspired by philosophy, literature and design, he’s questioning the politics of incontinence and the self’s irrational integrity as gateways to a more astute grasp of our humanity. 

As part of his theoretical practice the artist has lectured at (Royal College of Arts, London, Von Kraal Theatre, Estonia, Konstfack, Stockholm, Bezalel University of Art and Design, Tel Aviv) and has collaborated with artists/writers/musicians/designers/philosophers among which, Grit Hachmeister (DE), Elias Merino (ES), Graham Foust (US), Graham Harman (US). His work has been shown at Power Plant, Toronto, Glass Factory Lab, Boda, Mucsarnok Kunsthalle, Budapest, Center for Contemporary Art and National Museum, Warsaw, Museum of Contemporary Art, Bucharest, Kunsthalle Mulhouse, Kunsthalle Winterthur, Kunsthalle Bega, Centre for Contemporary Art, Tel Aviv, Royal Academy of Arts, London, and Venice Biennale.
