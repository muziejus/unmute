Barbara Maria Neu, clarinet / performance art

biography

Barbara Maria Neu studied classical clarinet at MDW Vienna and KUG Graz with Gerald Pachinger and performance art at Academy Of Fine Arts Vienna with Carola Derting. Moreover she received an education in acting (with Lena Kalisch) and speaking-techniques (with Lena Franke). Next to her work as a classical clarinetist and engagements as a free substition-musician at RSO Vienna, she operates with the artistic connection between music, performing and fine arts. 

As clarinetist and performance-artist she includes movement, voice, scenic performance, texts and visual aspects in her art and develops new work in collaboration with artists from various artistic fields. In her latest solo-performance STALLTÄNZE she worked with the composer Petra Stump-Linshalm and the theater-director Maria Sendlhofer. The piece shows work-steps and life of a goat-farmwoman in a music-performative way. Stalltänze (2020) was published both as DVD with artistic videos and as live stage-performance. 2021 Stalltänze will go on tour in Austria.

2020 Barbara Maria Neu received the Startstipendium für Musik und darstellende Kunst of Bundeskanzleramt Österreich (federal chancellery).
