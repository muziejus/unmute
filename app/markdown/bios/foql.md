FOQL stands for Justyna Banaszczyk – experimental electronic music and sound artist, author of radio dramas, film scores, and video game soundtracks. Her tracks bring to mind IDM and industrial, but their most distinctive feature are complex rhythms and often harsh sounds, constant exploration and contradicting the artist’s own musical identity – a trait that is reflected in her largely improvised live performances. Occasionally reaches for vinyls and four-track tape recorders to create sound collages and mixtapes under the moniker Głupiec (meaning “fool”).

SHAPE Platform artist in 2020, nominated by Unsound.

Justyna co-runs  Pointless Geometry label, which releases experimental electronic music. She is also co-founder of  Radio Kapitał, the first community radio in Poland. She is also former member of Oramics collective.
