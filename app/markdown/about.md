UN/MUTE-10002
February 12 - May 9, 2021
Please join us, February 12, 1pm EST to the launching of our project UN/MUTE-10002 
At facebook.com/undercurrent.nyc

Creating a fair and equitable space after COVID shuttered artists from
residencies, travel, studio visits, exhibitions, and physical networking,
UN/MUTE is an online residency that provides artists an opportunity for a
critical exchange and collaboration while simultaneously connecting resources
from the global cultural epicenter of New York City. This project is
co-organized by [Undercurrent](http://undercurrent.nyc) and the [European Union National Institutes for
Culture’s New York Cluster](http://eunicglobal.eu). It will go live on February 12,
2021, in concurrence with the Lunar New Year, and will continue through May
9th, celebrating Europe Day. 
 
The online world that has emerged in response to the pandemic reshapes our
definition of social contact, obscures our private and public environments,
and circumscribes the evolution of communication. UN/MUTE-10002 follows the
narratives of ten European artists who have never visited New York City and
ten NYC-based artists, paired into  teams of two, one European with one New
Yorker. Additionally, one artist is a digital immigrant, born before 1986, and
the other is a digital native, born into the world of web browsers and email,
after 1986. Over a series of Zoom sessions, each team’s collective creative
process will unfold in a series of video recordings.

Language serves as the first cultural indicator of change. At constant risk of
complete extermination, the Amazon is now more recognized as an online
shopping platform than one of our planet’s richest natural resources. We
stream video content into our living rooms while drinking bottled water
branded with pictures of mountain springs, and our most priceless memories are
hidden away in a cloud. We sit a virtual world apart from each other – far
more than the recommended six feet – obscuring the socioeconomic divisions of
race, color, national origin, gender identification, sexual orientation,
religion, and age. The present state of being often sounds more like mythology
or folklore than reality. 
 
As the internet conditions our lifestyle, we aim to find new normalcy amidst a
shortage of vaccines, new virus strains, unsettling unemployment rates, and a
Western world trying to mitigate racism and xenophobia during a delicate
sociopolitical epoch. Regardless of our facility with digital technologies,
how do we progress without compromising the past? How can we learn from each
other’s individual histories and experiences? Embodying inclusion,
multilingualism, and digitalization, UN/MUTE provides an opportunity for two
transatlantic strangers to collaborate on a singular project for a sustainable
future.
